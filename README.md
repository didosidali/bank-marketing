<h3>1.2 Business case</h3>

Term deposits, also known as bonds, refer to savings accounts that pay a fixed rate of interest (often better than just opening deposit account) until a given maturity date. Such funds generally cannot be withdrawn prior to maturity without paying a penalty. Banks usually try to leverage the data of their clients or other instituions' clients as well as third-party data in the hope of identiying the ones that are worthy to target, i.e. are likely to subscribe a term deposit, in their marketing campaigns. 

In this challenge, we to identify the customers that are likely to subscribe a term deposit based on data provided by a  Portuguese banking institution.
